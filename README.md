# Final Fantasy 6:  Kefka Rush
Welcome to my twelveth randomizer, this time from the Pixel Remaster of Final Fantasy VI!  In this randomizer, you will be given a number of scenarios, and your aim is to attempt to complete those scenarios.  You will be given just four characters to work with.

This will test how well you can manage your resources as you go through each scenario.  Enjoy and good luck!

# How to play
Download the FF6KefkaRush.zip file, and extract it.  Run the EXE, locate your MAIN FF6 PR folder, set your options, then click "Randomize" and you should be good to go.

# Other notable changes
- This is based off of Memoria, and in that spirit, you can toggle encounters on and off by pressing "F2". (this is HIGHLY discouraged!)

# Special Thanks
- mcgrew (Dragon Warrior Randomizer author) for inspiring me to create randomizers
- Albeoris - author of Memoria for the Pixel Remaster, which really helped me create this randomizer
## Beta helpers
(These have either reported bugs or offered an improvement that was implemented during the 0.x phase)
- None yet because this just got released...

NOTE:  This is a beta release.  **This will have bugs!**  Please let me know of those bugs as you encounter them.  Thanks!

# Enjoy and good luck!
