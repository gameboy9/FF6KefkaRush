# Final Fantasy 6:  Kefka Rush
Welcome to my twelveth randomizer, this time from the Pixel Remaster of Final Fantasy VI!  In this randomizer, you will be given a number of scenarios, and your aim is to attempt to complete those scenarios.  You will be given just four characters to work with.

This will test how well you can manage your resources as you go through each scenario.  Enjoy and good luck!

# How to play
Download the FF6KefkaRush.zip file, and extract it.  Run the EXE, locate your MAIN FF6 PR folder, set your options, then click "Randomize" and you should be good to go.

# Other notable changes
- This is based off of Memoria, and in that spirit, you can toggle encounters on and off by pressing "F2". (this is HIGHLY discouraged!)
- If you are given the Phantom Train scenario, you do not need to flip the switches to "stop the train"; you can go straight to the train boss fight.
  - Additionally, the ghosts are the only place you can sell and purchase things... I probably will remove that in future versions.
- If you are given the Opera scenario, you DO need to go right to flip the switch before going left, per usual.
